# **App Name**: NMCN Materials Hub

## Core Features:

- Zone Navigation: Display six buttons, one for each geo-political zone: Kano, Cross River, Plateau, Gombe, Ebonyi, and Ekiti.
- Material Download: Upon clicking a zone button, show all downloadable files (PDF, PPT, DOC, etc.) for that zone.
- Material Search: Implement a search bar to quickly locate materials by name.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Green (#008751), drawing inspiration from the Nigerian flag to honor the NMCN (Nursing and Midwifery Council of Nigeria) Examiner's Workshop in question.
- Background color: Very light green (#F0FAF4), maintaining the light theme with a desaturated hue from the primary color.
- Accent color: A vibrant lime green (#9EF01A), a brighter, more saturated and lighter tint analogous to the primary green, for highlighting interactive elements and calls to action.
- Font: 'Poppins', a clean and readable geometric sans-serif font suitable for headers and body text.
- The layout will consist of a header, the six zone cards arranged in a 2x3 grid, and a footer with the NMCN contact information. All arranged in a mobile-friendly responsive design.
